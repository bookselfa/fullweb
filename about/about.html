            <h2>What is COSMOS WINGS (Mission and Vision)?</h2>
        <h4>Mission:</h4>
        <p>As soon we found that there are a few NGO for dogs in Sonipat, and street 
            dogs are dying every day because no one is caring for them, <br> and then we found our mission.
        We understand that our Mission is to create a highly upgraded NGO for dogs,<br>
        in which all stray dogs able to live their whole life under good care.</p>
        <h4> Vision:</h4>
        <p>Our vision is to make a great life for every street dog by providing the shelter in our NGO for dogs. we want to spread the message of love,<br> peace, and harmony for the welfare of dogs among the animal lovers.<br>
            COSMOS WINGS is a Non-Profit Organization located in Sonipat.
            We are here to care for street dogs and other animals who are suffering<br> from health problems or hunger.
            We work with street dogs to make them healthy and happy.
            our work gives us immense pleasure.<br> We have a team of dedicated volunteers.
            Trustees of kazaalhelping.org guide their volunteers very well and cooperate with them<br> to work efficiently.
