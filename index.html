                <p>As soon we found that there are a few NGO for dogs in Sonipat, and street dogs are dying every day because no one is caring for them, and then we found our mission. <br>
                    We understand that our Mission is to create a highly upgraded NGO for dogs, in which all stray dogs able to live their whole life under good care.

Cosmos Wings will not be the only name This is a hope for those innocent dogs Whom no one supports Today, thousands of Street dogs in Delhi spend their days eating garbage. Even the Peoples beat the dogs without any reason, Dogs hands are broken in an accident, no cure is found.</p>
